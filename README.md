# 💼 Employee Salary Prediction App 🚀

Predict whether an employee earns **more or less than $50K** based on their demographic and professional details using a **Machine Learning classification model** — all through an interactive **Streamlit web app**! 🔍📊

---

## 🧠 Project Overview

This project leverages the **Adult Census Income dataset** to build a predictive model that classifies employee salary into two categories:

- **≤ 50K**
- **> 50K**

It is integrated with an easy-to-use Streamlit frontend and supports both **single-entry** predictions and **batch CSV uploads**. Ideal for HR use-cases, salary estimations, and educational ML demonstrations.
